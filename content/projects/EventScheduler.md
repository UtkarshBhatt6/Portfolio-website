## Description

This was a month-long project built during my summer holidays. Project goals included working with **Google and OpenAI APIs**. This is my first project using GenerativeAI to build products that simplify life.   
During this time I also researched authentication using **Google OAuth** protocol and how it can be used to gain limited access to a user's private resources. I also learned how to integrate Google Calendar into the web application. I also gained much experience working with OpenAI's endpoint, particularly for chat completion and using its text-DaVinci model for language processing.
I also learn a lot about prompt engineering and how to carefully design your prompt for getting the best results. The technologies used in this project are **ReactJS** for the frontend, **NodeJS** for the backend, **Google OAuth** for authentication,**OpenAi's API** for chat completion, and **Google Calendar API** for scheduling meetings.
