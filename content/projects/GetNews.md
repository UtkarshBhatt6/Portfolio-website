## Description

This is a task for entering into inter-iit tech dev team.I implemented this project using **NewsAPI** ,which is a very powerful API for scraping news from various sources.The project also uses **mongoDB** as the database for storing user's info who want to subscribe to newsletter service.The frontend of the app is built using **ReactJS** with **React Bootstrap** as the UI library.The backend uses **NodeJS** as the runtime environment and **Expressjs** as the framework.I have also containerized both frontend and backend of the application using **Docker**.
