## Description

Developed sentiment analysis models using machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify IMDb movie reviews as positive or negative.
Transformed textual data into feature vectors using both **Bag of Words (BoW) (achieving accuracy of 75.1% )** and **TF-IDF (achieving accuracy of 75.09% )** vectorization, enabling better analysis and machine learning model training.
Utilized various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, classification reports, and confusion matrices, to assess and report the performance of the sentiment analysis models.
