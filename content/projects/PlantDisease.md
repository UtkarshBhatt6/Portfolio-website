## Description

Developed a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** architecture using **Keras** and leveraged **OpenCV** for preprocessing tasks to classify plant diseases with an accuracy of **96.77 %**.
Utilized **Matplotlib** for data visualization to monitor the training and validation accuracy and loss curves, allowing for in-depth analysis of model performance and convergence.
Implemented the **Adam optimizer** with a specified learning rate and binary cross-entropy loss, streamlining the training process on a diverse dataset of plant images.
